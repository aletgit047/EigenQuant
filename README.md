# EigenQuant

**EigenQuant** is a mathematical framework designed for financial market analysis. By leveraging probability theory and structural data validation, the project aims to identify objective price accumulation zones and market patterns, moving beyond subjective chart analysis.

## 🎯 Project Goals
* **Data Integrity:** Implement a rigorous validation pipeline for financial time-series data.
* **Structural Analysis:** Identify key market levels based on statistical probability rather than visual intuition.
* **Professional Persistence:** Manage large-scale financial datasets using a relational PostgreSQL backbone.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
* **Language:** Python 3.x
* **Database:** PostgreSQL (via SQLAlchemy ORM)
* **Data Handling:** Pandas, NumPy

## 📁 Project Intent
This repository is part of my **professional portfolio**. The primary goal is to demonstrate my ability to apply mathematical concepts to financial data, manage relational databases (PostgreSQL), and write clean, modular Python code. 

*Note: This is an analytical tool, not a commercial trading platform.*
